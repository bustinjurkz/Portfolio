                  The Capstone course at McMaster University&apos;s Computer
                  Science Dept. was a year-long course where small groups had to
                  complete a large project. Ideally, these projects would
                  incorporate the learnings from the years prior. I was lucky
                  enough to be able to make my first video game under the
                  supervision of{" "}

                    I think a video game really incorporates everything there is
                    about computer science. Handits is a co-op 2D
                    puzzler/platformer where the mouse (or right joystick)
                    controls your character&apos;s hand in 360Â°. Players
                    manipulate the handit&apos;s hand and toss, grab, snap,
                    slap, pull, wave, push, and shoot in order to safely collect
                    hidden relics.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The game engine used was Unity and involves many C# scripts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Game design principles were studied. The creation of an
                  on-going Game Design Document helped to organize our many
                  ideas.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The first deliverable was a Proof of Concept involving the
                  main mechanics. It was then subjected to playtesting in order
                  to continuously refine the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The aesthetics were both custom-made from scratch and modified
                  using openly licensed files.
                </li>
                <li>
                  My group dynamic was efficient due to our use of Scrum
                  methodology in order to accomplish the most out of the 2
                  full-time semesters my peers and I had. We would do weekly
                  sprint plan meetings and divide up the many tasks that pertain
                  to game development.

                  I would love to return to video game design one day. I feel it
                  provides me with a great creative outlet and fuller
                  utilization of my skills, since I also love creating music.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is easier to make it as an actor than a video game
                  developer. The amount of respect I have for those grinding it
                  out in the gaming industry is astronomical.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Constant playtesting (or UX testing in web development) is
                  tantamount to the success of your project.
